Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up my macOS laptop.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Forked from [thoughtbot/laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) script.

Install
-------

Download and execute the script:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanaghdam/laptop/master/mac | sh 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/issues/new) for us.
Or, attach the whole log file as an attachment.
